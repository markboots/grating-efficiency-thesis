Hi Mark,

The gratings are in your cubical, in a black case under your desk (beside your
file drawer).  Sorry it couldn't be smaller - it's the best I could do on short
notice to fit all 6 grating holders (The holder are bigger than I recalled).

There's a combination lock on it, the combo's (see email).  I left a keyed lock on your desk if you prefer, or none, it's probably not important - just to keep snoopy customs officers out without you standing over them.

Unfortunately, my handcuffs are in Calgary...

Inside, under the top foam sheet there're some documents and labels:

-Fragile labels
-ID labels

Put whatever you're comfortable with on the case.

-Emails from BACH which may help show they were shipped to us (and cleared
customs) already.  These also show pictures of a grating and a similar grating
case in various stages of disassembly in the hopes that you can show them
what's inside the cases without being asked to open one.

There're also gloves in case you are asked to open them (and begging, bribing
and offers of sexual favors haven't dissuaded them), though you'll need a hex
wrench (and a cleanroom for preference).

-There are also the emails from the CLS optics guys with their test results.



-David
