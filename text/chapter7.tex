\chapter{Future work: What should have been in Chapter 6}

     - Grating efficiency engine: own open-source software [combine differential method and RCWA… use as check on each other, or within areas of applicability]
          - Cloud computing: distribute over many cores, but only for a short time.  Calculations can be done massively in parallel.
          - web service accessible to beamline designers everywhere
     - Make beamline work… Publish actual spectrometer results
