% ABSTRACT
\abstract{
For almost two hundred years, diffraction gratings have been -- and still are -- at the heart of many instruments responsible for breakthroughs in scientific understanding.  Today, diffraction gratings are used in astronomy telescopes, chemistry spectrographs, spectrophotometers for life science, and in optics for material science experiments, over a range of wavelengths from the far infrared to soft x-rays.  The sensitivity and speed of these instruments depends on the efficiency of gratings, i.e., the intensity of useful diffracted light compared to the incident light.  In some cases -- such as Peter Zeeman's famous discovery of energy level splitting in a magnetic field -- improvements in grating efficiency make a previously-undetectable effect detectable.  

To support these applications, one component of my graduate work has focussed on the diffraction efficiency of gratings.  While this research happens to be applicable to a wide range of scenarios -- both theoretical and applied, I have been working toward a very tangible application: designing and optimizing an innovative soft x-ray emission spectrometer for the REIXS beamline at the Canadian Light Source.  Over the course of this project, I used and created software tools to calculate diffraction efficiency, applied these tools to understand efficiency trends, and used them in the optical design of the spectrometer.  

I also measured the efficiency of real-world gratings and compared these measurements with calculations. TODO.

%
\input chapter1.tex
\input chapter2.tex
\input chapter3.tex
\input chapter3_5.tex
\input chapter4.tex
\input chapter5.tex
\input chapter6.tex
