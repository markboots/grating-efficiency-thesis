\chapter{Introduction}

The \emph{diffraction grating} is an optical component that exploits interference from a periodic surface of parallel grooves to control light based on its wavelength.  For almost two hundred years, diffraction gratings have been -- and still are -- at the heart of many instruments responsible for breakthroughs in scientific understanding.  Today, they are are used in astronomy telescopes, chemistry spectrographs, spectrophotometers for life science, and in optics for material science experiments, over a range of wavelengths from the far infrared to soft x-rays.  The sensitivity and speed of these instruments depends on the efficiency of their gratings, i.e., the intensity of useful diffracted light compared to the incident light.  In some cases -- such as Peter Zeeman's famous discovery of energy level splitting in a magnetic field -- improvements in grating efficiency made a previously undetectable effect detectable.

To support and advance these techniques, this project sought to understand and improve the diffraction efficiency of gratings.  While the research happens to be applicable to a wide range of scenarios -- both theoretical and applied, it was focused on a tangible goal: designing and optimizing an innovative soft x-ray emission spectrometer for the REIXS beamline at the Canadian Light Source.  Over the course of the project, we used and created new software tools based on rigorous electromagnetic theory (Chapter 3) to calculate diffraction efficiency.  We applied these tools to understand efficiency trends, and used them to design the optics for the spectrometer.  The software tools, described in Chapter 4, were written to harness high-performance computing resources where available, and have been released to allow other beamline designers to quantify and optimize their own designs.  In examining the trends (Chapter 5), we compared different groove shapes, analyzed the effects of material and geometry parameters, and discovered new principles that can be applied to instrument design, including the principle of optimal incidence.  We used this understanding to design an innovative spectrometer that balances efficiency with high resolving power, and extended its performance by exploiting an efficiency peak in the third diffraction order.  (Chapter 6 describes the design process we used.)

Once the spectrometer gratings were manufactured, we also measured their real-world efficiency and compared it with our calculations (Chapter 7).  The measured efficiencies were very different from the original predictions, but we accounted for the discrepancy based on real-world effects and manufacturing differences: geometry errors, groove variation, surface roughness, and oxidation.  We also discovered a fitting technique that could predict the real grating parameters based on the shape of the measured efficiency curves.  Because each parameter affects the efficiency curves in a different way, we found that would could predict multiple parameters, and confirmed the accuracy of the geometry predictions using atomic force microprobe (AFM) measurements of the actual grooves.  Other parameters like the surface roughness and the oxide thickness are difficult to measure, at least non-destructively; however, the exactness of the fit achieved for all gratings increases our confidence in the theoretical calculations, and suggests it might be possible to use the fitting technique to characterize grating parameters that are infeasible to measure directly.

In most cases of beamline design, the diffraction efficiency is hardly considered, or left up to the grating manufacturer.  It is even more rare to actually {\emph{test}} the gratings for their real efficiency.  The REIXS spectrometer project was successful because we were able to combine rigorous efficiency calculations with ray-tracing predictions of the resolution, and use both to navigate the compromise between these two competing factors.  Commissioning of the real-world spectrometer is still ongoing, but preliminary results (Chapter 8) confirm that our design process produced an effective and useful instrument for material scientists.  In its high efficiency mode, the spectrometer offers competitive resolution and four to six times the throughput of a comparable spectrometer at the Advanced Light Source; it also offers a high resolution mode to push deeper into the electronic structure of new and novel materials.  In addition to this physical instrument, we hope that our efficiency calculation methods and software will be useful in the design of future record-setting soft x-ray beamlines.
