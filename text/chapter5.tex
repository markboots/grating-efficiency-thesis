challenge: blaze angle numerical measurements... requires calibration of z-axis.

\section{Diffractometer measurements of actual grating efficiency}

- If you know groove density: can position to detector to correct angle as you scan energy. Otherwise, need to scan angle to find diffraction peak, and take eff. there.

The diffraction orders are visible as peaks along the outgoing angle axis (here, measured up from the grating surface at 0 $\deg$).  The 0th order (reflection) peak is easily visible at twice the incident angle.  (Grating: HRHEG)}

This allows faster, continuous efficiency measurements as a function of  photon energy.  (Grating: LEG)}

\section{Real-world grating effects}
\subsection{Stray Radiant Energy}
http://gratings.newport.com/information/technotes/technote9.asp
\subsubsection{Surface roughness}
 (scattering: uniform decrease in efficiency)
  Other way to think about: periodic structures with \emph{many} frequency components. Diffract all over the place.
  
  TODO: Find reference and descriptive math...
  
          - Not modelled.  Accept a uniform constant reduction (usually about ~50\%) lower due to scattering.

   \caption{Roughness of the grating surface scatters stray light outside the diffraction orders}
   \label{5e}
\end{figure}
       

\subsubsection{Dust, scratches, pinholes act as scattering centers}
\subsubsection{Irregularities in the groove position create ghost peaks}
\subsubsection{Irregularities along the groove direct light elsewhere}
reflect off axis... reduce periodicity... disrupt the perfect grating model. May be directed or diffuse.

\subsection{IMP} (nickel): Profile clean, blaze angle off [modelled].  Oxidized… Modelled as NI, layer of NiO.

TEST: NiO on top of Ni? layer thickness
Caveat: Henke data reflectivities are not correct at/near absorption edges... shouldn't totally match theoretical shape.

 (Pt): blaze angles very off… Unsuitable for actual application in 3rd order.
          - Temporary plan: Using HRHEG (2600l/mm) in place of HEG (2000l/mm) since blaze angle error makes it suitable for use in 1st order.
