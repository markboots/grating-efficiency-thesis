% FRONTMATTER - In this section, specify information to be used to
% typeset the thesis frontmatter.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% THESIS TITLE
% Specify the title. Set the capitalization how you want it.
\title{Designing and Optimizing Gratings for Soft XRay Diffraction Efficiency}

% AUTHOR'S NAME
% Your name goes here.
\author{Mark Boots}

% DEGREE SOUGHT.  
% Use \MSc or \PhD here
\degree{\MSc}         

% EXPECTED CONVOCATION DATE

% NAME OF ACADEMIC UNIT
%
% The following two commands allow you to specify the academic unit you belong to.
% This will appear on the title page as
% ``<academic unit> of <department>''.
% So if you are in the division of biomedical engineering you would need to do:
 \department{Physics and Engineering Physics}
% \academicunit{Division}
%
% The default is ``Department of Computer Science'' if these commands
% are not given.
%
% If you are in a discipline other than Computer Science, uncomment the following line and
% specify your discipline/department.  Default is 'Computer Science'.
% \department{If not Computer Science, put the name of your department here}

% If you are not in a department, but say, a division, uncomment the following line.
% \academicunit{Put the type of academic unit you belong to here, e.g. Division, College}


% PERMISSION TO USE ADDRESS
%
% If you are not in Compuer Science you will want to change the
% address on the Permission to Use page.  This is done using the
% \ptuaddress{}.  Example:
%
 \ptuaddress{Head of the Department of Physics and Engineering Physics\\
 Rm 123 Physics Building\\
 116 Science Place\\
 University of Saskatchewan\\
 Saskatoon, Saskatchewan\\
 Canada\\
 S7N 5E2

% Since thesis chapters are very long and there are a lot of them, it is recommended
% that you put each chapter in a separate .tex file and \input each one of them
% in order.  For example:
%
\input chapter1.tex
\input chapter2.tex
\input chapter3.tex
\input chapter4.tex
\input chapter5.tex
\input chapter6.tex
\input chapter7.tex

% ...

% The \input command inserts contents of the specified file at the point of the command.

% The Bibliograpy should go here. BEFORE appendices!
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


% Typeset the Bibliography.  The bibliography style used is "plain".
% Optionally, you can specify the bibliography style to use:
% \uofsbibliography[stylename]{yourbibfile}

\uofsbibliography{880Paper}

% If you are not using bibtex, comment the line above and uncomment
% the line below.  
%Follow the line below with a thebibliography environmentand bibitems.  
% Note: use of bibtex is usually the preferred method.

%\uofsbibliographynobibtex

% Any chapters appearing after the \appendix command get numbered with
% capital letters starting with appendix 'A'.
% New chapters from here on will be called 'Appendix A', 'Appendix B'
