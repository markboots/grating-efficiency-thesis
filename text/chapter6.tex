\chapter{Real-World Results and Future Work}

%- Real-world results:
%     - Problems with spectrometer:
%          - Mechanical design flaws (crashing; hexapod range)
%          - electrical wiring and noise problems (sensitive detector in-vacuum; can't be on long signal cables)
%          - Grating manufacturing, as covered above.
%
%- Preliminary results


% Ongoing:

%          - Cloud computing: distribute over many cores, but only for a short time.  Calculations can be done massively in parallel.
%          - web service accessible to beamline designers everywhere
