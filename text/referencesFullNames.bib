	Abstract = {An extremely high resolution flat field type slit less soft x-ray emission spectrometer has been designed and constructed for the long undulator beamline BL07LSU in SPring-8. By optimizing the ruling parameters of two cylindrical gratings, a high energy resolution #x394;E #38;#60; 100 meV and/or an E/ #x394;E #x223c; 10 000 are expected for the energy range of 350 eV #x2013; 750 eV taking into account the broadening by the spatial resolution (25 #x3bc;m) of a CCD detector. A coma-free operation mode proposed by Strocov etal, is also applied to eliminate both defocus and coma aberrations. The spectrometer demonstrated experimentally that E/ #x394;E = 10 050 and 8046 for N 1s (402.1 eV) and Mn 2p (641.8 eV) edges, respectively.},

@article{Ghi06,
	Abstract = {We present a 5 nbsp;m long spectrometer for soft x rays to be used at a synchrotron radiation beamline for resonant x-ray emission spectroscopy and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering in the 400 #x2013;1600 nbsp;eV energy range. It is based on a variable line spacing spherical grating (average groove density of 3200 nbsp;mm-1, R=58.55 nbsp;m) and a charge coupled device two dimensional detector. With an x-ray spot on the sample of 10 nbsp; #x3bc;m, the targeted resolving power is higher than 10 #x2009;000 at all energies below 1100 nbsp;eV and better than 7000 at 1500 nbsp;eV. The off-line tests made with Al and Mg nbsp;K #x3b1;1,2 fluorescence emissions indicate that the spectrometer can actually work at 12 #x2009;000 and 17 #x2009;000 resolving power at the L3 edges of Cu (930 nbsp;eV) and of Ti (470 nbsp;eV), respectively. SAXES (superadvanced x-ray emission spectrometer) is mounted on a rotating platform allowing to vary the scattering angle from 25 #xb0; to 130 #xb0;. The spectrometer will be operational at the ADRESS (advanced resonant spectroscopies) beamline of the Swiss Light Source from 2007. },

@article{Pad94,
	Abstract = {In general, the diffraction efficiency of gratings is limited by the constraints imposed by the type of geometry used to scan the photon energy. In the simplest example, the spherical grating monochromator, the deviation angle, the grating groove width and depth and the groove density are all constrained by considerations of the maximum photon energy and the tuning range for individual gratings. We have examined the case in which these parameters are unconstrained, resulting in predictions of the ultimate performance of lamellar type gratings for groove densities from 300 to 2400 1/mm for gold and nickel coatings. The differential method of Neviere et al. (Nouv. Rev. Opt. 5 (1974) 65) was used for modeling the behavior of the gratings and justification is presented for this by rigorous comparison with measurements. The implications of these results for future monochromators based on a variable-included-angle geometry are discussed.},

	Abstract = {The optimization of grating parameters for constant deviation mountings in the soft X-ray domain is conducted using electromagnetic theory as a tool. In the first step, the influence of groove geometry and groove spacing is studied in detail. Then, the optimization of groove depth and groove width is conducted for lamellar gratings for the three most representative groove frequencies (600, 1200, 2400 g/mm). A range of grazing incidences are studied, corresponding to deviations between beams from 142 to 176{\^A}$\,^{\circ}$ and wavelengths from 8 {\~A}{\ldots} with some results for sinusoidal gratings shown for comparison. For the optimum lamellar gratings, efficiency curves are drawn, for a monochromator configuration, showing the polarization effects. The energy diffracted in second and third orders is given, in order to show higher order contamination.},

@article{Jar88,
	Abstract = {In this article data are presented that show the validity of the reciprocity theorem for diffraction by a blazed grating in the soft X-ray region. With this theorem, a simple formula for the calculation of the diffraction efficiency in blaze maximum can intuitively be derived. Calculations with this formula will be compared to experimental data for first and second order diffraction. Isoefficiency curves for these orders can also be drawn from the experimental data. These will be used to discuss the working parameters of some monochromator designs. By combining the advantages of two well-known monochromator concepts, a new design will be proposed that will allow high resolution while it can be optimized for high transmission and good suppression of higher harmonics.},

They occur at observed wavelengths for which light of the same wavelength is diffracted in another order so as to graze the surface of the grating.

Some experimental observations of Wood anomalies are described, including a new finding concerning the reluctance of two anomalies to coincide. Finally, a discussion is given of spectrophotometric errors introduced by Wood anomalies.},

Experimental results are compared with predictions of Beckmann's scalar theory and Rayleigh's vector theory. The measured scattering pattern has a background of scattered light due mainly to residual surface roughness. Also the power in the higher-order peaks is larger by several orders of magnitude than the computed one, which can be attributed mainly to the low-order contributions of the harmonics in the profile.},

	Abstract = { Abstract This review is intended to provide a critical and up-to-date survey of the analytical approximate methods that are encountered in scattering from random rough surfaces. The underlying principles of the different methods are evidenced and the functional form of the corresponding scattering amplitude or cross-section is given. The reader is referred to the original papers in order to obtain the explicit expressions of the coefficients and kernels. We have tried to identify the main strengths and weaknesses of the various theories. We provide synthetic tables of their respective performances, according to a dozen important requirements a valuable method should meet. Both scalar acoustic and vector electromagnetic theories are equally addressed. },

	Abstract = {This bending magnet beamline has been in operation since February 1995 for the characterization of optical elements (mirrors, gratings, multilayers, detectors, etc.) in the energy range 50 #x2013;1000 eV. Although it was designed primarily for precision reflectometry of multilayer reflecting optics for EUV projection lithography, it has capabilities for a wide range of measurements. The optics consist of a monochromator, a reflectometer, and refocusing mirrors to provide a small spot on the sample. The monochromator is a very compact, entrance #x2010;slitless, varied #x2010;line #x2010;spacing plane #x2010;grating design in which the mechanically ruled grating operates in the converging light from a spherical mirror working at high demagnification. Aberrations of the mirror are corrected by the line spacing variation, so that the spectral resolving power #x3bb;/ #x394; #x3bb; is limited by the ALS source size to about 7000. Wavelength is scanned by simple rotation of the grating with a fixed exit slit. The reflectometer has the capability of positioning the sample to within 10 #x3bc;m and setting its angular position to 0.002 #xb0;. LABVIEWTM based software provides a convenient interface to the user. The reflectometer is separated from the beamline by a differential pump and can be pumped down in 1/2 hour. Auxiliary experimental stations can be mounted behind the reflectometer. Results are shown that demonstrate the performance and operational convenience of the beamline #xa9; 1996 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Kro26,
	Abstract = {After a brief summary of the ideas underlying the quantum theory of dispersion it is shown that it can be applied to the refraction of x-rays, although the assumption that the number of atoms in a wave length cube is large is no longer satisfied. A general formula for the index of refraction in terms of the atomic absorption coefficient a and the critical frequencies is given. From the condition, experimentally verified, that the electrons in the atom for impressed frequencies, large compared to their natural frequencies, shall act like free electrons as far as the index of refraction is concerned, a relation is obtained for a. From the failure of this relation when applied to the groups of electrons separately, conclusions are drawn as to the coupling of the groups. Some considerations on the origin of the Compton shifted radiation are added, from which it appears that in the wave description this radiation must be regarded as coming from all the atoms and as being coherent with the incident waves; a result suited to stress the difficulty of harmonizing the wave picture with that of quantum processes in the atoms.},

	Abstract = { Models for predicting the groove profile of metal coated holographic gratings, fabricated in positive photoresist, are studied. Development is assumed to be an etching process, where the etching is directed perpendicularly to the resist-developer interface. Two methods for metal coating are considered; vacuum evaporation and sputtering, and models that describe the profile formation for these cases are presented. It is noted that even a thin coating has a considerable effect on the profile. The theoretical groove profiles are found to be in good agreement with experimental profiles, obtained from SEM photographs of fabricated gratings. },

	Abstract = { An ion-etching technique has been successfully applied to the production of blazed holographic plane gratings having various blaze angles ranging from 7 to 26 degrees. Efficiencies of the gratings thus produced were measured in the Littrow configuration as functions of an ion-etching condition, wavelength, and angle of incidence. The maximum efficiency for p -polarized light was found to be more than 64 per cent at about 3250 + for gratings etched at the beam angle of 80 degrees. Experimental results show that ion-etched gratings have the blaze property equivalent to that of holographic gratings made by means of Sheridon's method. },

This approach allows an arbitrary complex permittivity to be used for the material and thus avoids the infinite conductivity (perfectconductor) approximation.

Diffraction characteristics for rectangular-groove gold gratings with equal groove and ridge widths are presented for freespace wavelengths of 0.5, 1.0 and 10.0 {\textmu}m for all diffracted orders as a function of period, groove depth, polarization, and angle of incidence. Results include the following: (1) TM-polarization diffraction characteristics vary more rapidly than do those for TE polarization, (2) 95\% first-order diffraction efficiency occurs for TM polarization at 10.0 {\textmu}m, (3) \&lt;0.1\% zero-order specular reflectivity occurs for both TE and TM polarizations, (4) \&gt;50\% absorption of incident power occurs at 0.5 {\textmu}m, and (5) the perfect-conductor approximation is not valid for TM polarization at any of the wavelengths and is not valid for TE polarization at 0.5 {\textmu}m.},

@article{Hen93,
	Abstract = {The primary interactions of low-energy x-rays within condensed matter, viz. photoabsorption and coherent scattering, have been described for photon energies outside the absorption threshold regions by using atomic scattering factors. The atomic scattering factors may be accurately determined from the atomic photoabsorption cross sections using modified Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations. From a synthesis of the currently available experimental data and recent theoretical calculations for photoabsorption, the angle-independent, forward-scattering components of the atomic scattering factors have been thus semiempirically determined and tabulated here for 92 elements and for the region 50-30,000 eV. Atomic scattering factors for all angles of coherent scattering and at the higher photon energies are obtained from these tabulated forward-scattering values by adding a simple angle-dependent form-factor correction. The incoherent scattering contributions that become significant for the light elements at the higher photon energies are similarly determined. The basic x-ray interaction relations that are used in applied x-ray physics are presented here in terms of the atomic scattering factors. The bulk optical constants are also related to the atomic scattering factors. These atomic and optical relations are applied to the detailed calculation of the reflectivity characteristics of a series of practical x-ray mirror, multilayer, and crystal monochromators. Comparisons of the results of this semiempirical, ``atomic-like`` description of x-ray interactions for the low-energy region with those of experiment and ab initio theory are presented.},

	Abstract = {The problem of diffraction at a sinusoidally stratified dielectric grating is treated. The analysis of the reconstruction process from a hologram formed in a ``thick'' photographic emulsion leads to this problem, but it may also occur in other areas. A rigorous solution of this problem is presented for both polarizations of the electric wave. The solution is evaluated numerically for values of the different parameters that are typical for holograms. It is shown that the amplitude of the diffracted light has a maximum if the light is incident at the Bragg angle, a feature already observed experimentally. Results are given for different values of the period as well as the thickness of the grating and for both polarizations.},

	Abstract = {A rigorous coupled-wave approach is used to analyze diffraction by general planar gratings bounded by two different media. The grating fringes may have any orientation (slanted or unslanted) with respect to the grating surfaces. The analysis is based on a state-variables representation and results in a unifying, easily computer-implementable matrix formulation of the general planar-grating diffraction problem. Accurate diffraction characteristics are presented for the first time to the authors' knowledge for general slanted gratings. This present rigorous formulation is compared with rigorous modal theory, approximate two-wave modal theory, approximate multiwave coupled-wave theory, and approximate two-wave coupled-wave theory. Typical errors in the diffraction characteristics introduced by these various approximate theories are evaluated for transmission, slanted, and reflection gratings. Inclusion of higher-order waves in a theory is important for obtaining accurate predictions when forward-diffracted orders are dominant (transmission-grating behavior). Conversely, when backward-diffracted orders dominate (reflection-grating behavior), second derivatives of the field amplitudes and boundary diffraction need to be included to produce accurate results.},

@article{Gor02,
	Abstract = {The near-normal-incidence efficiencies of a 2400-groove/mm holographic master grating, a replica grating, and a multilayer grating are modeled in the soft-x-ray-extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) regions and are compared with efficiencies that are measured with synchrotron radiation. The efficiencies are calculated by the computer program PCGrate, which is based on a rigorous modified integral method. The theory of our integral method is described both for monolayer and multilayer gratings designated for the soft-x-ray-EUV-wavelength range. The calculations account for the groove profile as determined from atomic force microscopy with a depth scaling in the case of the multilayer grating and an average random microroughness (0.7 nm) for the short wavelengths. The refractive indices of the grating substrate and coatings have been taken from different sources because of the wide range of the wavelengths (4.5--50 nm). The measured peak absolute efficiency of 10.4\% in the second diffraction order at a wavelength of 11.4 nm is achieved for the multilayer grating and is in good agreement with a computed value of ~11.5\%. Rigorous modeling of the efficiencies of three similar gratings is in good overall agreement with the measured efficiency over a wide wavelength region. Additional calculations have indicated that relatively high normal incidence efficiency (of at least several percent) and large angular dispersion in the higher orders can be achieved in the 4.5--10.5-nm range by application of various multilayer coatings.},

	Abstract = {An analysis is made of a rigorous and an approximate approach to the solution of the diffraction problem for a multilayer-coated X-ray grating by the integral equation formalism. Whereas a rigorous analysis involving the integral method requires a lot of computer resources, even for gratings with a small number of layers, the approximate approach based on a modification of the solution of the integral equation at the lower boundary with a finite conductivity is practically independent of the number of layers and is readily tractable with the use of a standard PC. The efficiencies of multilayer gratings measured at grazing angles with synchrotron soft X-ray radiation are compared with the values calculated using the integral approaches for ideal groove profiles.},

@article{Pop04,
	Abstract = {The recently developed fast Fourier factorization method, which has greatly improved the application range of the differential theory of gratings, suffers from numerical instability when applied to metallic gratings with very low losses. This occurs when the real part of the refractive index is small, in particular, smaller than 0.1--0.2, for example, when silver and gold gratings are analyzed in the infrared region. This failure can be attributed to Li's ``inverse rule'' \[L. Li, J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 13, 1870 (1996)\] as shown by studying the condition number of matrices that have to be inverted. Two ways of overcoming the difficulty are explored: first, an additional truncation of the matrices containing the coefficients of the differential system, which reduces the numerical problems in some cases, and second, an introduction of lossier material inside the bulk, thus leaving only a thin layer of the highly conducting metal. If the layer is sufficiently thick, this does not change the optical properties of the system but significantly improves the convergence of the differential theory, including the rigorous coupled-wave method, for various types of grating profiles.},

@article{Moh95,
	Abstract = {An enhanced, numerically stable transmittance matrix approach is developed and is applied to the implementation of the rigorous coupled-wave analysis for surface-relief and multilevel gratings. The enhanced approach is shown to produce numerically stable results for excessively deep multilevel surface-relief dielectric gratings. The nature of the numerical instability for the classic transmission matrix approach in the presence of evanescent fields is determined. The finite precision of the numerical representation on digital computers results in insufficient accuracy in numerically representing the elements produced by inverting an ill-conditioned transmission matrix. These inaccuracies will result in numerical instability in the calculations for successive field matching between the layers. The new technique that we present anticipates and preempts these potential numerical problems. In addition to the full-solution approach whereby all the reflected and the transmitted amplitudes are calculated, a simpler, more efficient formulation is proposed for cases in which only the reflected amplitudes (or the transmitted amplitudes) are required. Incorporating this enhanced approach into the implementation of the rigorous coupled-wave analysis, we obtain numerically stable and convergent results for excessively deep (50 wavelengths), 16-level, asymmetric binary gratings. Calculated results are presented for both TE and TM polarization and for conical diffraction.},

@article{Pop00,
	Abstract = {Using theorems of Fourier factorization, a recent paper \[J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 13, 1870 (1996)\] has shown that the truncated Fourier series of products of discontinuous functions that were used in the differential theory of gratings during the past 30 years are not converging everywhere in TM polarization. They turn out to be converging everywhere only at the limit of infinitely low modulated gratings. We derive new truncated equations and implement them numerically. The computed efficiencies turn out to converge about as fast as in the TE-polarization case with respect to the number of Fourier harmonics used to represent the field. The fast convergence is observed on both metallic and dielectric gratings with sinusoidal, triangular, and lamellar profiles as well as with cylindrical and rectangular rods, and examples are shown on gratings with 100\% modulation. The new formulation opens a new wide range of applications of the method, concerning not only gratings used in TM polarization but also conical diffraction, crossed gratings, three-dimensional problems, nonperiodic objects, rough surfaces, photonic band gaps, nonlinear optics, etc. The formulation also concerns the TE polarization case for a grating ruled on a magnetic material as well as gratings ruled on anisotropic materials. The method developed is applicable to any theory that requires the Fourier analysis of continuous products of discontinuous periodic functions; we propose to call it the fast Fourier factorization method.},

	Abstract = { The problem of diffraction from lossless reflection gratings is treated with a modal expansion formulation which incorporates an impedance condition on the mode eigenfunctions along the groove aperture. The theory for both fundamental polarizations is applied to three different grating profiles and is found to yield results which conform well with predictions of an established integral theory over a restricted range of groove depths. The upper bounds on these depths are approximately 0·2 periods for the symmetrical triangular profile and 0·5 periods for the semi-circular and sinusoidal profiles. Beyond these limits numerical instabilities occur and the results often fail to satisfy standard numerical tests. },

	Abstract = {We establish the most general differential equations that are satisfied by the Fourier components of the electromagnetic field diffracted by an arbitrary periodic anisotropic medium. The equations are derived by use of the recently published fast-Fourier-factorization (FFF) method, which ensures fast convergence of the Fourier series of the field. The diffraction by classic isotropic gratings arises as a particular case of the derived equations; the case of anisotropic classic gratings was published elsewhere. The equations can be resolved either through classic differential theory or through the modal method for particular groove profiles. The new equations improve both methods in the same way. Crossed gratings, among which are grids and two-dimensional arbitrarily shaped periodic surfaces, appear as particular cases of the theory, as do three-dimensional photonic crystals. The method can be extended to nonperiodic media through the use of a Fourier transform.},

The new formulation converges faster because it uniformly satisfies the boundary conditions in the grating region, whereas the old formulations do so only nonuniformly. Mathematical theorems that govern the factorization of the Fourier coefficients of products of functions having jump discontinuities are given. The results of this paper are applicable to any numerical work that requires the Fourier analysis of products of discontinuous periodic functions.},

	Abstract = { Abstract The feasibility of making a frequency doubler for integrated optics is studied with the electromagnetic theory of gratings and graded-index waveguides as a tool. The device consists of a first waveguide filled with a sol-gel nonlinear material doped or grafted with a nonlinear chromophore whose thickness is chosen to generate a second-harmonic Cerenkov radiation in a dispersive glass substrate. The Cerenkov radiation is coupled into a second waveguide through a graded-index layer produced by ion exchange into glass, lying on top of an ion-etched grating coupler. The aim of the study is to optimize the optogeometrical parameters of the device in order to obtain a resonance line of the second waveguide modes that has an angular width large enough to match the experimental constraints, and which leads to a good enough coupling coefficient. The electromagnetic theory of grating couplers is developed into an S-matrix propagation algorithm form in order to be combined with the electromagnetic analysis of the thick graded-index waveguide with a view to analysing the device. },

Many implementation variants of the algorithmsare also presented. Their physical interpretations are given, and their numerical stabilities and efficiencies are discussed in detail. The single most important criterion for achieving unconditional numerical stability with both algorithms is to avoid the exponentially growing functions in every step of the matrix recursion. From the viewpoint of numerical efficiency, the S-matrix algorithm is generally preferred to the R-matrix algorithm, but exceptional cases are noted.},

	Abstract = {An electromagnetic study of the staircase approximation of arbitrary shaped gratings is conducted with three different grating theories. Numerical results on a deep aluminum sinusoidal grating show that the staircase approximation introduces sharp maxima in the local field map close to the edges of the profile. These maxima are especially pronounced in TM polarization and do not exist with the original sinusoidal profile. Their existence is not an algorithmic artifact, since they are found with different grating theories and numerical implementations. Since the number of the maxima increases with the number of the slices, a greater number of Fourier components is required to correctly represent the electromagnetic field, and thus a worsening of the convergence rate is observed. The study of the local field map provides an understanding of why methods that do not use the staircase approximation (e.g., the differential theory) converge faster than methods that use it. As a consequence, a 1\% accuracy in the efficiencies of a deep sinusoidal metallic grating is obtained 30 times faster when the differential theory is used in comparison with the use of the rigorous coupled-wave theory. A theoretical analysis is proposed in the limit when the number of slices tends to infinity, which shows that even in that case the staircase approximation is not well suited to describe the real profile.},

	Abstract = {We present a new rigorous integral formalism for the theoretical study of dielectric coated gratings and grating couplers. It applies in the resonance domain, where the wavelength of the incident field and the groove spacing are of the same order of magnitude. The computed program issued from this theory extends the domain of application of the previous differential or integral theories. It can be used to investigate, with a very good accuracy, the properties of bare or dielectric coated gratings, for any groove shape and any polarization, in the entire visible, ultraviolet, and infrared regions. Various classical criteria are used to control the validity of the numerical results and comparisons are made with the numerical results obtained using the previous integral and differential formalisms. Two examples of applications are given. First, we show that the new possibilities of our program lead to a better agreement between theoretical results and experimental data. Second, a theoretical study of a certain type of grating coupler is given.},
